# Phys-sim_Releases

**The game is in very early development!**

**i would be only releasing dev versions here on github and then i would release full one on my itch.io** (on itch.io i might make it a small price like 1-3$)

but you can download the dev builds from: **[Releases Tab](https://github.com/moxi-u7/Phys-sim_Releases/releases)**


> it's in very very early development so don't expect anything shocking until First Release (when the "-dev" tag is deleted it would mean it's production version) production versions are gonna be on my itch.io

### Late Updates
Updates might be late because I don't have time for it. Life can get busy, and sometimes other priorities take over. I appreciate your patience and understanding as I work to catch up. Rest assured, Iâ€™m doing my best to provide the latest information as soon as I can. Thank you for sticking with me!
