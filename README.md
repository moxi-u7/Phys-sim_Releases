# Phys-sim_Releases

**The game is in very early development!**

**i would be only releasing dev versions here on github and then i would release full one on my itch.io** (on itch.io i might make it a small price like 1-3$)

but you can download the dev builds from: **[Releases Tab](https://github.com/moxi-u7/Phys-sim_Releases/releases)**


> it's in very very early development so don't expect anything shocking until First Release (when the "-dev" tag is deleted it would mean it's production version) first release are gonna be on my itch.io
